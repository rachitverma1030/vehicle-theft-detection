# vehicle-theft-detection

Purpose of project:
 
Peoples are using the manufacturer security alarm only. The thief had an experience regarding this security 
alarm, which means their work is getting easier to steal the car because they had well known about the alarm 
circuit. They know when the time to cut off the alarm and had well known about the system. So, it is 
important to double protect the security of the vehicle.  Vehicle Theft Detection utilizes a GSM to monitor 
and safeguard a vehicle.  
 
It automatically demobilizes the vehicle by disconnecting the ignition key supply from the car 
battery. This now makes it impossible for anybody to starts the vehicle, let alone moving with it. 
In an attempt of theft through the vehicle doors or boot, the system sends text message to the 
vehicle owner. This design popped out due to the increasing rate at which packed vehicles are 
stolen especially in our country, but with this design this packed vehicle is being monitor red 
irrespective of where it is packed, provided there is GSM network coverage.
